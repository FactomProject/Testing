This chain contains a record of the results of testing of the Factom API since June 23, 2015. 

There are two types of entries in this chain:

Factom API Test Plan - the testing plan for the Factom API that was performed on a particular date
Factom API Test Script - the script that was used to execute that plan on that date 

The current version of the Factom API Test Plan is always available at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pGTIIEIHFgzCT13NWmajFvcwV_HbpgpNHWnAqmp7WvY/edit?pli=1#gid=3815258

The current version of the Factom API Test Script is always available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CwFrDIxlKQoHvI9QaP0Bj47ljHywhiNaa1FqSw3pK6Y/edit?pli=1

This entry (the 1st in the chain) contains:

- the name of the chain "Factom API Testing" as the External ID

- this explanation

- the public key of the digital signature ("D. Robert Baker <drobertbaker@factom.org>") with which each authentic entry is signed

Each subsequent (authentic) entry in the chain contains:

- a hash of the file containing the testing data

- (on the same line) the file name (which includes the date as part of the file name) of the data file

- the digital signature of "D. Robert Baker <drobertbaker@factom.org>"

The detection and filtering of the few intentionally included "fake" records (without an authentic signature) is left as an exercise for the so-inclined.

VERIFYING AN ENTRY

The signature of an entry must be verified to ensure that it was filed by an authorized party. This is done by using any digital signature verification software. 

First, import the public key given below into the digital signature verification software.
 
Then run the signature of an entry through the digital signature verification software. 

If the signature is not verified as belonging to "D. Robert Baker <drobertbaker@factom.org>", then the entry has not been properly authorized.

VERIFYING A FILE

Run the file to be checked for validity through the widely available "sha256sum" software, e.g.

sha256sum filename

to generate a hash code for that file. 

Then compare the generated hash code to the hash code given in the entry. 

If they match, then the file is authentic. 

If the two hash codes do not match, then the file is not the same as the one that was filed by Factom.
