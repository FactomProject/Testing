To get the latest API code:

for each terminal window (factomd, fctwallet, and operating) run go-version.sh by COPYING the following line in that terminal window:
. ~/testing/testing/test-plans-and-scripts/github/get-latest-code/go-version.sh

Then copy this line one time into the 3rd terminal window:
. ~/testing/testing/test-plans-and-scripts/github/get-latest-code/sweep-environment.sh

In 1st terminal window:
~/go/bin/factomd
